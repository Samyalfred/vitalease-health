  <h1>5 Natural Ways to Boost Your Immune System</h1>
  <p>Keeping your immune system strong is essential to staying healthy. Here are 5 natural tips that can help your body fight off illnesses and stay energized.</p>

  <h2>1. Eat More Fruits and Vegetables</h2>
  <p>Fruits and vegetables are rich in vitamins, antioxidants, and minerals that support immune health. Aim for colorful produce like oranges, spinach, carrots, and berries.</p>

  <h2>2. Stay Hydrated</h2>
  <p>Water flushes out toxins and keeps your system functioning properly. Drink at least 8 glasses a day, and consider herbal teas like ginger or turmeric for added benefit.</p>

  <h2>3. Get Enough Sleep</h2>
  <p>Adults need 7–9 hours of sleep per night. Quality sleep helps regulate immune responses and repair the body.</p>

  <h2>4. Exercise Regularly</h2>
  <p>Moderate exercise like walking, yoga, or cycling boosts circulation and immune cell function. Aim for 30 minutes a day.</p>

  <h2>5. Manage Stress</h2>
  <p>Chronic stress weakens the immune system. Try deep breathing, journaling, or mindfulness to keep your stress levels in check.</p>
