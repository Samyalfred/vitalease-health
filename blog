  <h1>5 Foods That Naturally Boost Your Immunity</h1>
  <p>Your immune system is your body’s first line of defense — a silent warrior that protects you from illness, infection, and fatigue. But did you know that what you eat can either strengthen or weaken this natural shield?</p>

  <p>In this post, we explore five powerful, science-backed foods that do more than just satisfy your hunger — they actively support your immune function, increase your resistance to illness, and help you stay energized and resilient all year long.</p>

  <h2>1. Citrus Fruits</h2>
  <p>Loaded with vitamin C, citrus fruits like oranges, lemons, and grapefruits help stimulate white blood cell production.</p>

  <h2>2. Garlic</h2>
  <p>Garlic has powerful anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties. It’s great in soups and stir-fries.</p>

  <h2>3. Ginger</h2>
  <p>Ginger helps reduce inflammation and oxidative stress. It’s especially effective when consumed as tea.</p>

  <h2>4. Spinach</h2>
  <p>Spinach is packed with vitamin C and antioxidants. Light cooking enhances its nutrient absorption.</p>

  <h2>5. Yogurt</h2>
  <p>Yogurt provides probiotics that support a healthy gut — the foundation of a strong immune system.</p>
