    <p>Discover natural superfoods that protect your body daily</p>

  <main>
    <p>Did you know that your immune system can be strengthened by what you eat? When your immune system is strong, your body fights infections and diseases more effectively. In this post, you‚Äôll learn about five powerful foods that naturally boost immunity and how to include them in your diet.</p>

    <h2>1. Garlic üßÑ</h2>
    <p>Garlic contains a compound called allicin, known for its ability to fight infections and reduce inflammation. Whether added to soup, stew, or tea, it‚Äôs a natural antibiotic that protects the body from viruses and harmful bacteria.</p>

    <h2>2. Ginger üåø</h2>
    <p>Ginger is rich in antioxidants and helps reduce inflammation. It's effective for sore throats and respiratory infections. You can add fresh ginger to tea, smoothies, or cooked meals.</p>

    <h2>3. Citrus Fruits üçä</h2>
    <p>Vitamin C-rich fruits like oranges, lemons, limes, and grapefruits help increase white blood cell production. These cells are your immune system‚Äôs first defense against invaders. Drink fresh juice or eat them whole for the best results.</p>

    <h2>4. Spinach ü•¨</h2>
    <p>Spinach is not just rich in Vitamin C but also contains beta carotene and other antioxidants that increase the body‚Äôs ability to fight infections. Light cooking enhances its benefits without reducing nutrients.</p>

    <h2>5. Yogurt ü•£</h2>
    <p>Yogurt contains probiotics‚Äîfriendly bacteria that support your gut health and immune system. Choose plain, unsweetened yogurt and add honey or fruits for flavor. Daily intake improves digestion and reduces illness risk.</p>

    <p><strong>Health Tip:</strong> Pair these foods with regular exercise, quality sleep, and hydration for a stronger immune system!</p>
