    <p>Maintaining a strong immune system is essential for staying healthy and fighting off infections. The good news? You can enhance your body‚Äôs defense naturally through what you eat. Here are five powerful foods known to boost immunity:</p>

    <h2>1. Garlic üßÑ</h2>
    <p>Garlic has been used for centuries for its medicinal properties. It contains allicin, a sulfur compound that boosts the immune system by fighting bacteria and viruses. It also reduces inflammation and supports heart health.</p>

    <h2>2. Ginger üå±</h2>
    <p>Ginger is packed with antioxidants and has anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial effects. It's great for easing sore throats and colds, improving digestion, and supporting your body‚Äôs natural immune response.</p>

    <h2>3. Citrus Fruits üçä</h2>
    <p>Oranges, lemons, grapefruits, and limes are loaded with Vitamin C ‚Äî a key nutrient that helps your body produce white blood cells to fight infections. Regular intake can reduce the duration and severity of colds.</p>

    <h2>4. Spinach ü•¨</h2>
    <p>Spinach is a superfood rich in Vitamin C, beta carotene, and antioxidants. These nutrients work together to enhance the infection-fighting ability of your immune system while also supporting skin and eye health.</p>

    <h2>5. Yogurt ü•£</h2>
    <p>Yogurt contains probiotics (good bacteria) that help regulate the digestive system and strengthen the immune system. Look for yogurt with ‚Äúlive and active cultures‚Äù and consider low-sugar varieties.</p>

    <p><strong>Bonus Tip:</strong> Drink plenty of water, reduce sugar intake, and get enough sleep. These lifestyle choices, along with healthy food, keep your immune system strong and ready.</p>
